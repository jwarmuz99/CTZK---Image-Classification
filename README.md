# Sneakers model prediction using Convolutional Neural Network 

Implementaton of CNN on a real life dataset with the use of [fast.ai](fast.ai) library. 

The model was deployed online and can be accessed [here](https://ctzk.onrender.com/). It was trained on the web scraped images of 15 types of sneakers, such as Nike Air Force 1, Air Jordan 11 or Yeezy Boost 350. Pytorch's pre-trained ResNet34 was used, and the error rate of 0.1 on the validation set was achieved.

Next iterations of the project would involve adding more sneaker types and developing a more sophisticated way to handle the unknown ones.
